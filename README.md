## 🎨 Customization

### 🎭 UI Themes

Modify the CSS variables in `popup.html`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  --secondary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #48bb78 0%, #38a169 100%);
  --tertiary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #ed8936 0%, #dd6b20 100%);
}
```

### 🤖 AI Behavior

Customize AI responses in `server.mjs`:

```javascript
const SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
  hint: "Provide a concise hint in 10-12 words...",
  timeComplexity: "Return only the Big O notation...",
  spaceComplexity: "Return only the space complexity..."
};
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔒 Is my code secure?</strong></summary>

Yes! Your code is processed locally and only minimal context is sent to the AI for analysis. No code is stored permanently.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ The extension isn't extracting my code. What should I do?</strong></summary>

**For Code Extraction Issues:**
1. **Check Console Logs**: Open DevTools (F12) and look for "CodeHint:" messages
2. **Verify Editor Support**: Ensure you're using a supported editor (Monaco, ACE, CodeMirror, or textarea)
3. **Wait for Page Load**: Some editors need time to initialize - wait 2-3 seconds after page load
4. **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and reload CodeHint AI
5. **Check Platform**: Verify you're on a supported coding platform

**Debug Information:**
- The extension logs which extraction method succeeded
- If no code is found, it lists available editors on the page
- Look for messages like "Code extracted via Monaco API: [length] characters"

**Common Solutions:**
- Refresh the coding platform page
- Ensure your code is actually in the editor (not just in the problem description)
- Try typing a few characters in the editor to ensure it's active
- Check if the editor is inside an iframe (some platforms use frames)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 General troubleshooting steps</strong></summary>

1. **Server Issues**: Ensure the server is running (`npm start`)
2. **API Issues**: Check your Gemini API key in `.env`
3. **Extension Issues**: Reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
4. **Network Issues**: Check the browser console for network errors
5. **Platform Changes**: Some platforms update their UI - the extension adapts automatically

<div align="center">

**Made with ❤️ by developers, for developers**

*Happy Coding! 🚀*

</div>

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY"
```
**Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from Google AI Studio.**

c.  Start the Backend Server:
Run the server from the same directory:

```bash
npm start
```
You should see `Server is running on http://localhost:3000` in your terminal. Keep this terminal open while using the extension.

3. Frontend Extension Build (if using Vite/React)
If your project includes a frontend build process (e.g., using Vite/React, as suggested by previous conversations), you'll need to build the extension files.

a.  Install Frontend Dependencies:
If your frontend has a separate package.json (or if it's in the same root, run npm install again to ensure all dev dependencies are installed):

```bash
npm install
```

b.  Build the Extension:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist` folder containing the compiled extension files.

4. Load into Chrome
Now, load the extension into your Chrome browser:

a.  Open Chrome Extensions:
Open your Chrome browser and navigate to chrome://extensions.

b.  Enable Developer Mode:
Toggle on the "Developer mode" switch, usually found in the top right corner.

c.  Load Unpacked Extension:
Click the "Load unpacked" button.

d.  Select Extension Folder:
Browse to your CodeHint directory.
* If you performed the frontend build step (Step 3), select the dist folder inside your CodeHint directory.
* If you don't have a build step, select the main CodeHint directory itself.

e.  Pin the Extension (Optional):
Click the puzzle piece icon next to your address bar, then click the pin icon next to "CodeHint AI" to pin it to your toolbar for easy access.

💡 Usage
Navigate to a Problem Page: Go to any problem page on LeetCode (leetcode.com/problems/), GeeksforGeeks (geeksforgeeks.org/), or Codeforces (codeforces.com/).

Open the Extension: Click on the CodeHint AI icon in your browser toolbar.

Interact:

Type your code into the problem editor on the webpage.

Click "Get Hint" for a small nudge.

Click "Get Solution" for a high-level approach.

Click "Time Complexity" to analyze the time complexity of your code or the problem.

Click "Space Complexity" to analyze the space complexity of your code or the problem.

You can also type general questions into the input box and press Enter for a chat response.

Dark Mode: Use the moon/sun toggle button in the top right corner to switch between light and dark themes.

Scroll to Top: Use the floating arrow button in the bottom right to quickly scroll to the top of the chat history.

✏️ Editing the Code
This project is designed for easy local development and customization.

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):

You can directly edit popup.html (for UI structure and basic styling), popup.js (for frontend logic and interaction), and any associated CSS files.

After making changes, if you have a build step (like Vite), run npm run build again.

Then, reload the extension in Chrome (chrome://extensions -> refresh icon for CodeHint AI). Your changes will be reflected immediately.

Backend (Node.js Server):

Edit server.mjs to modify how hints are generated, add new API endpoints, or change AI model interaction.

After making changes, you must restart your backend server (Ctrl + C then npm start) for the changes to take effect.

This "edit" process is fundamental to how browser extensions and Node.js applications are developed. You modify the source files, rebuild (if necessary), and then reload the application to see your changes.

🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please feel free to:

Fork the repository.

Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).

Make your changes.

Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new feature').

Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature).
